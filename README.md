Users can connect to and control the telescope through a web app and see live data from the telescope, as well as run guided experiments.

### Goal for first experiments:

- Detecting the 1420MHz "Hydrogen Line" and locating the galactic center.
- Connecting to weather satellites and downloading live earth images.
- Detecting known pulsar sources and measuring their rotation speed.

### Features:

- Rooftop single dish antenna design.
- Realtime motorized control of antenna direction to sky.
- Self contained electronics.
- Webserver for controlling and viewing telescope data from phone/tablet.
- Low cost.
- Weatherproof.
